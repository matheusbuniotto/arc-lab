# Atomic Habits — Chapter 1

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

## Summary

Small habits compound. Focus on systems, not goals. Identity-based habits: "I am a reader" vs "I want to read."

## My take

Connects to [[habit-stacking]] and [[systems-vs-goals]]. Relevant for [[management]] and personal productivity.
