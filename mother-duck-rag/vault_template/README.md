# Vault template for Arc-Lab

Copy this folder (or its contents) as the starting point for your Obsidian vault. Then point Arc-Lab’s `VAULT_PATH` to the vault root and run `make ingest`.

See [../docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_STRUCTURE.md](../docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_STRUCTURE.md) for the full guide.

## What’s inside

- **00-MOCs/** — Map-of-content examples (AI, Learning).
- **02-Learning/** — Example book, course, and talk notes with frontmatter.
- **04-Slipbox/** — Example permanent notes.
- **_templates/** — Obsidian template files (use with Obsidian’s Templates plugin).

Start by editing the examples and adding your own notes under the same structure.
